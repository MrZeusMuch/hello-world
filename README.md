# Hello-world
I want to learn how to build websites. So here we go.
I'll start off by learning HTML and CSS. At the moment am using Khan academy and Cisco to understand what needs to be done. Am planning to make a couple of simple websites for friends and family.
Hopefully I can do something awesome the more I learn. Wish me luck.
